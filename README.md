# three-js-puzzle-cube

An interactive puzzle cube using ThreeJS.

Future goals for this project:

-   Add configurable keys, so that the user could assign any moves or
    combinations of moves (algorithms) to any key press

-   Add ability for cubies to align themselves to the x, y, z, grid, to prevent
    floating point error rendering issues after using the program for a long
    time

-   Add scrambler to be able to scramble the cube with a single button

-   Add intuitive UI to be able to use the program from a computer or mobile
    device

-   Add timer, inspection time, and the ability to hide the cube from the user
    while scrambling so that the user first sees the scramble during inspection
    time

-   Add solver to solve the cube with a single button

-   Deploy the program so that people can use it and try it out easily

-   Make the cube and the cube's background more visually appealing (lighting,
    textures, etc.)

-   Add ability to change move speed

-   Add ability to change move animation function (linear, bezier, etc.)

-   Add ability for custom textures

-   Add ability to save configurations to local storage

-   Add ability to import and export configurations to/from local storage

-   Add additional game modes to help people get "hooked"
